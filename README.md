# Pose-Estimation
I've use Multiperson Openpose to detect the person with keypoints of 18 points.
Further I extract the x and y values of left and right Wrist and Ear points to detect if person is using phone or not. 
For the distance formula I've used Euclidean Formula to see the difference. This code takes bunch of single person images from a specified folder
finds keypoints and euclidean distance of both sides.
